 ## Code Comments:

 Take a look at my inline code comments in the pull request for specific notes on code.

 ## Deployment:

 > Did you successfully deploy your project to github pages? Is the app's functionality the same deployed as it is locally?

 **3: Excelling.** Both the deployed app and local version are running smoothly.

 ## Technical Requirements:

 > Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

 **3: Excelling.** More than surpassed the minimal requirements. You definitely pushed yourself here!

 ## Code Quality:

 > Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

 **3: Excelling.** Your code is neat, well-organized and the naming conventions, for the most part, make sense. There are a few opportunities for refactoring, but I know you spent a considerable amount of time on this already. Really impresed.

 ## Creativity/Interface:

 > Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

 **3: Excelling.** It's clear that you were very thoughtful in how you decided to style your app. My only quibble is personally not liking buttons that look like the default, but that's a small point.
